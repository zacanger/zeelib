* Revive this
* Bring back anything useful from old versions
* Get 100% test coverage
* Aim for no useless imports (avoid the lodash problem)
* Aim for ES2024+/Node21+ compatibility only
* See if Node's builtin test runner can get coverage with TS yet
* Get rid of eslint/prettier, just use ts-standard
* Remove anything that can be done with plain JS now
