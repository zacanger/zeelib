* If you can, please _add_ a test.
* Please add your thing in `src/index.ts` (alphabetically; `:sort u` in Vim).
* Please make sure you fill out the issue or PR template accurately.
* If submitting a PR, please make sure you've run the tests with `npm t`.
* Please use the current latest `npm` and install with `npm ci` (unless you're intending to modify dependencies).
