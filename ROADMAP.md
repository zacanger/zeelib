Roadmap/TODO list (for no release in particular):

* Switch to using [jsdoctap](http://npm.im/jsdoctap) for tests
* 100% flow coverage
* 100% test coverage
* Remove all weak types
* Build TS libdefs
* Remove all `$FlowFixMe`s
* `import foo from 'zeelib/foo'` instead of `'zeelib/lib/foo'`
* Doc
  * TOC sections (can [doctoc](https://github.com/thlorenz/doctoc) help here?)
  * Fix all functions that are wrapped in `curry` so documentation.js actually knows what to do with them
